# Structurizr DSL in TypeScript - Layer 2

## Overview
The modules provides a TypeScript-based framework for defining software architecture in code.<br>
It lets you express [the structurizr language](https://structurizr.com/) into TypeScript classes, giving you fine-grained control over your system's structure and relationships.<Br> This layer is designed to make your architecture more tangible, bringing it closer to your everyday coding practices.

## Features

-   Express your software architecture using TypeScript.
-   TypeScript classes for software systems, containers, components, and more.
-   Take advantage of TypeScript's autocompletion and type checking.
-   Create and maintain your architecture alongside your codebase.
-   Seamless integration with modern development tools.

## Installation

```
npm install @c4-model/language
```

## Usage
- Define your architecture: Create classes for your software systems, containers, components, and relationships. Use the Structurizr DSL as a reference for your architecture.

- Generate diagrams: Use the provided rendering tools to create visual representations of your architecture directly from your TypeScript code.

- Incorporate into documentation: Include the generated diagrams in your project's documentation or share them with your team.
